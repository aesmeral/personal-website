Hello Readers!

This is my second ever blog post! I want to try and be consistent and post once a month atleast. In this post, I just want to share my experience on the reality of working from remote from a different country! Especially when you're at +15 time difference from where you originally work at. There are definitely some pro and cons. However, I will definitely recommend it to anyone who has the opportunity to do so! 

## The Good

I'd like to consider myself an early bird.. I usually wake up at 7am and start work at 8am; If I really have too, I can get myself up by 5 am. So, when I decided to work remote at the Philippines, I knew that my schedule would be a little wonky, but thankfully my team lead was very considerate and told me not to be working at midnight. Thus, I decided that it would be best to try and work at 6am up to 2pm Philippines time ofcourse which would be 4pm - 12 am. Meaning, I was still able to have atleast 1 hour to sync up with my team and respond to slack messages at a timely manner if I was required to respond. In addition to that, I had other teammembers who were really supportive during my time here by offering to come back later online (8pm their time) to pair and also catch me up to speed with what's going on.

Working in the morning always gave me some sort of productivty boost because there's not much in my life for the most part that happens in the morning. Whether it's in LA or here in the Philippines. Especially here in the Philippines, even though all my family members wake up as early as I do.. they also have a lot to do in the mornings. After that, towards the afternoon.. that's what a lot of things start to happen and lot's of [salu-salo](https://www.wordhippo.com/what-is/the-meaning-of/filipino-word-13886b8a0213d1125ac2b67e3a19c4e62fba9e0f.html). Anyways, because of how not busy it is in the morning, it forces me to be productive and this is when I get most of my work done! In addition to that, my performance doesn't really seem to be affected as much as I thought it would be based off looking at my JIRA board.

## The Bad

There are really only two complaints I have working in the Philippines; but this is only based off my own experience.

1. Brownouts
2. Poor internet quality

Where I am from.. Igbaras, Iloilo a small town near the mountains of the Iloilo island it is very common for brownouts. Luckily during my time here, I've only experienced 5 brownouts and 4 out of the 5 happened outside my work schedule. However, that 1 time that it did occur I was basically disconnected from work. I couldn't access Jira, Slack, and GitHub which is the essentials for any developer working remotely. However, I did have LTE on my phone but when I tried to make it a hotspot for my Macbook, it just wasn't enough to load a website in the desktop version.

As for poor internet quality, I think this is mostly based on my area.. As there is only 1 cell tower which is quite far from the town, In addition to that the internet you either get is either wireless (something like what T-Mobile is offering with their 5G networks) OR is broadband, up to 100Mbps. The problem with the first one is that if there any bad signals or really too much colliding frequencies, then your internet suddenly drops or is really slow. The second one, broadband.. you're essentially on the same bandwidth with the entire town which is about 32,000 people with no back channel. I can really feel the difference of just latency and speed between working at 5am and working at 12pm. Towards the end of the day it just takes way too long for a response
